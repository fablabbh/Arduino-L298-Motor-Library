  Fablab Bahrain L298 Motor Driver Library
  ----------------------------------------
  This library was developed by Fablab Bahrain a community makerspace in Bahrain that provides access to digital fabrication tools and technologies.
  You can learn more about Fablab Bahrain and its services at https://linktr.ee/fablabbh.
  
  About This Example Code
  -----------------------
  This example shows how to control a motor using serial input. The user can enter a PWM value between 0 and 255 to control the speed and direction of the motor.
  
  About This Library
  ------------------
  The library provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling motors using the L298 H-bridge motor driver. The library supports setting the motor speed, direction, and braking.
  To use this library, you will need an L298N motor driver module. You can find the datasheet for the L298N chip at https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/l298.pdf.
  You can purchase the L298N module on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/L298N-Controller-Stepper-Driver-Module/dp/B014KMHSW6.

  Wiring:
  -------
  Connect the following pins on the L298N module to the corresponding pins on your Arduino board:
    ENA: Connect to a PWM-enabled pin on the Arduino (e.g. pin 5)
    IN1: Connect to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g. pin 6)
    IN2: Connect to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g. pin 7)
